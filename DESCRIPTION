Description: Package to evaluate the efficacy of different vaccination
    programmes. The method uses provided data on Influenze Like Illness counts,
    lab results on actual Influenza occurrence classified by strain and the current
    vaccine programme, uptake rates to fit an epidemiological model that takes into
    account different age groups and risk groups. The fitted results can then be
    used to predict the outcome of changes to the vaccination programme.
